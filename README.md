# Scroll animation
This project is useful for web dynamic pages for whom like to see a slide a slide and fade in effect in the content appearing in the screen. It's very used nowadays by modern websites.

## My difference between structor code.
- Clean code.
- Functional code to reusability and code organization.
- Added fade-in effect to the animated elements.
